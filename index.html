            <p>Dear Friends,</p>

            <p>I am both happy and proud to invite you to the celebration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Surgical Planning Laboratory.</p>

            <p>From humble beginnings in corners of unused spaces in the Radiology Department at Brigham and Women's Hospital, the SPL has evolved to become the hub of groundbreaking multi-disciplinary medical research activities both inside  the hospital and across the globe. It has been my privilege to see advances in medical imaging, surgical planning, image-guided therapy, visualization, and the understanding of disease happen daily in and around the SPL over the past twenty-five years.</p>

            <p>While the almost unbelievable progress in computational and medical technologies that have occurred since the lab opened have helped made these breathroughs possible, the unique strength of the SPL has always been you: hundreds of people from many disciplines, nationalities, educational and cultural backgrounds, all working together to change the face of medicine.  Not only has the SPL benefited from your efforts, many of you have carried the spirit of the lab back to your home institutions and driven even further innovation.</p>

            <p>Please join us to celebrate the SPL at a symposium and reunion on the Harvard Medical School Campus on April 8 and 9, 2016. Tours of AMIGO, the embodiment of our dear mentor Ferenc Jolesz's vision for image-guided therapy, will be also available. <p>

            <p>Please register for the event on this page and watch for more information.  There is a $200 registration fee to cover expenses.</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/spl25-tickets-19546375736"><b>SPL25 Registration and Preliminary Schedule</b> (Eventbrite)</a></p>

            <p>I look forward to seeing many of you in April to exchange old stories, share current happenings, and dream new visions for the future.</p>

            <p>Best Regards,<br/>Ron Kikinis</p>
