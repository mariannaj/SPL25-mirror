            <p>Dear Friends,</p>

            <p>I am delighted to invite you, the alumni/ae and friends of the SPL, to participate in the celebration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Surgical Planning Laboratory.</p>

<p>From humble beginnings in corners of unused spaces in the Radiology Department at Brigham and Women's Hospital, the SPL has evolved into a leading institution in medical image computing, both investigating novel technologies and using them for biomedical research. It has been my privilege to both lead and participate in many of these activities.</p>

<p>The unique strength of the SPL has always been the spirit and exceptional quality of its international community of investigators and partners, all working together to change the face of medicine. Not only did the SPL benefit from your efforts, but many of you have carried the spirit beyond the SPL to wherever you are today.</p>

<p>Please join us to celebrate the SPL at a symposium and reunion at Brigham and Womenâ€™s Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston on April 8 and 9, 2016.</p>

<p>Best Regards,<br/>Ron Kikinis</p>
